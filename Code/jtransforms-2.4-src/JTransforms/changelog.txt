JTransforms changelog
2.4:    July 30, 2011
    - Added support for unit-tests (JUnit)
    - Added support for code coverage analysis (Cobertura)
    - Updated Ant file accordingly (generation of HTML reports)
    - Added class RealFFTUtils_2D to make access to the data resulting from a real FFT transform more easily accessible.
    - Added class RealFFTUtils_3D to make access to the data resulting from a real FFT transform more easily accessible.
    - Fixed bugs in DoubleFFT_3D and FloatFFT_3D
2.3:	February 27, 2009
	- Performance improvements for 3D FFT (realForwardFull() and realInverseFull() for not power-of-two sizes).
	- Cosmetic changes.

2.2:	January 30, 2009
	- Fixed race condition in 3D FFT (realForwardFull() and realInverseFull() for not power-of-two sizes).
	- Refactoring in ConcurrencyUtils.
	- Cosmetic changes.	 

2.1:	December 12, 2008
	- Added Bluestein's FFT algorithm that significantly increases the performance and fixes accuracy issues when 
	  the size of the data is a number with a large prime factor.
	- Added extra digits to the floating-point constants.
	- The root mean square (RMS) error is now computed in all accuracy classes.  

2.0:	November 19, 2008	
	- Added mixed-radix algorithms for all transforms (no more power-of-two size limitation).

1.7:	August 4, 2008
	- Fixed bug causing ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when 1D FFT transforms were run  in the following order:
	  realFrowardFull(); complexInverse(); realForwardFull().
	- Added javadoc distribution.
	- Bzip2 is used to compress tar archives.

1.6:	July 15, 2008
	- Fixed bug causing error in realForwardFull() and realInverseFull() methods (3D FFT) when multiple threads were used.	
	- Added real Discrete Hartley Transforms (DHT).
	
1.5:	June 13, 2008
	- Fixed bug causing error when setNumberOfProcessors() was called after creating new instance of a transform. 
	- Loop unrolling in scale. 
	- Refactoring in ConcurrencyUtils.
	- Improved benchmarks.

1.4:	June 4, 2008
	- Fixed bug causing errors in DoubleFFT_2D and FloatFFT_2D. 

1.3:	May 7, 2008
	- From now on, realForward() followed by realInverse() returns the original data.
	- Added new variants of 1D transforms that allow to specify the offset in the input array.
	- Added new variants of constructors for 1D transforms.
	- Refactoring in the utility methods.
	- Multiple sizes of each transform are now checked in the accuracy checks.
	- The documentation has been updated.

1.2:	January 1, 2008
	- Added true multidimensional variants of 2D and 3D transforms.
	- Added single precision transforms.   

1.1:	September 23, 2007
	- Added discrete sine transforms. 

1.0:	August 29, 2007
	- Initial release.
